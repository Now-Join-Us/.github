## Welcome to Now-Join-Us Group ðŸ‘‹

We are a research group initially established by some LAMDA members on the large model branch (LAMDA-LM). Our primary focus is on technologies related to large language models and various foundation models. Recently, our key interests include:

* Model selection from a large zoo without inference
* General training and dynamic compatibility
* Adaptive training data engine
* Efficient domain reuse (adaptation)
* Comprehensive evaluation framework
* Parameter alignment and merging
